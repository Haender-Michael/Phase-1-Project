# Risk Assessment: Analysis for best Aicraft Acquisition.
## Introduction
For this analysis, we will use the dataset  **"Aviation Accident Database & Synopses, up to 2023"** from Kaggle, provided by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). This dataset contains comprehensive information about aviation incidents.

Our goal is to analyze accident patterns, aircraft reliability, evolution of accident frequency in aviation incidents. We will generate data-driven insights that will help the new aviation division in identifying the safest aircrafts for purchase and determining the best strategies for fleet management.

## Dataset overview
- Aircraft Makes and Models: Information about the specific make and model of the aircraft involved in each incident.
- Event date : the specific date each incident happened.
- location : The location where the aviation accident took place.
- injury severity: the Gravity and the amount of injuries.
- Aircraft Damage : the state of Aircrafts after accident.
- weather conditions

the dataset also contains other information, that are less relevant to the analysis.
##### N.B: the dataset is not up to date. Any analysis conducted will only be representative of the approximate year range from 1982 to 2023.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
For the purpose of this analysis we will take the following steps:
- Data cleaning
- Data Understanding
- Data Analysis
- Recommendations
- Summary
